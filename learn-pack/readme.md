<h2>GeeXLab Learning Pack</h2>

The learn-pack contains code samples sorted by difficulty.
This demo pack is a nice way to discover GeeXLab. You can see it
as an entry point to GeeXlab programming. Once you will be 
more comfortable with these samples, you will be able to browse
the whole code sample pack without fear.

Demos of this learning pack rely on OpenGL 2.1. Why OpenGL 2.1?
Because it's the only 3D API available on all platforms supported
by GeeXLab: Windows, Linux, macOS and above all Raspberry Pi.

The learn/01-basic/ folder covers all fundamental demos that are 
the base blocks for other more advanced demos. Each demo in this 
folder is based on concepts introduced in previous demos. 

The learn/01-intermediate/ folder covers more interesting features 
and effects like lighting shaders, simple physics, webcam, post 
processing or particles.

A learn/03-advanced/ and maybe a learn/04-graphics-hackers/
subpacks are planned...
